    --------    Garbage Collection (GC)    --------
    In C++:
        Uses the keyword "delete" to free memory.
        Also "destructor" runs when an object goes out of scope.
        uses 'new' to allocate memory

    In Java:
        No destructor — memory is automatically cleaned up by Garbage Collector (GC).
        The GC runs automatically (called by Java run-time system), but when it runs is unpredictable.
        
        When no references point to an object, it is 'marked' for garbage collection.
        GC reclaims memory only when necessary (not immediately after an object becomes unused).


    How GC works:
        When no references point to an object, Java considers it unreachable and marks its memory for cleanup. 
        That memory is then recycled for future use when needed.


    When Does GC Run?
        Java's garbage collection system automatically reclaims memory from objects that are no longer needed. 
        This process happens behind the scenes, without any action required from the programmer.

        Garbage collection doesn't happen immediately after objects become unused. 
            It runs only when the Java run-time decides it's appropriate.
        
        For efficiency, the garbage collector typically runs when:
            There are objects that can be recycled.
            There's a need for additional memory or system resources.

        As a result, you can't predict exactly when garbage collection will occur during a program’s execution.



    --------  memory allocation using new  --------
    we know:
        Primitive variables hold actual values.
        Object variables hold references (pointers) to objects.

    'new' for allocaton:
        In C++ we can use "new" for primitive types like int, float.
        In Java, no need to use new for primitive types (int, float, char, etc.).



    --------  finalize()  --------
    A special method called just before an object is destroyed by GC (final destruction).
        It can be used to ensure that an object terminates cleanly. 
        eg: Used for cleanup tasks (like closing a file).

    Syntax:
            protected void finalize() {
                // finalization code
            }

        Here, the keyword "protected" is an access specifier.


    To add a finalizer to a class, you simply define the finalize() and 
        inside finalize() specify those actions that must be performed before an object is destroyed.
 
    Important notes:
        finalize() is unpredictable — no guarantee when it runs.
        It's not called when an object goes out of scope.
        Not a direct replacement for C++ "destructors".
        Should be used as a backup for resource management, not relied on for "regular cleanup".


    Java does not have "destructors": 
        A C++ destructor is always called just before an object goes out of scope
        But Java's use of garbage collection, there is little need for a destructor.

/* Example 1: Demonstrating garbage collection via finalize().
                You often need to create and destroy a "large number of objects".

                This program creates a large number of objects.
                    At some point, garbage collection runs, and finalize() is called for collected objects.
                    You'll see messages like "Finalizing 12345" in the console.

// corrected, cleaned-up, and properly formatted version of your code with comments clarified where needed:

    int x;  // instance variable

    // Constructor
    FDemo(int i) {
        x = i;
    }

    // Called when the object is recycled by the garbage collector
    protected void finalize() {
        System.out.println("Finalizing " + x);
    }

    // Generates an object that is immediately eligible for garbage collection
    void generator(int i) {
        FDemo ob = new FDemo(i);
        // 'ob' goes out of scope here and becomes unreachable
    }
}

class FinalizeDemo {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int count;

        FDemo ob = new FDemo(0);  // creating an initial object

        // Now, generate a large number of objects.
        // At some point, garbage collection will run and call finalize().
        for (count = 1; count < 100000; count++)
            ob.generator(count);
    }
}
✅ Key Corrections:
Fixed class name in main() wrapper: Finalize → FinalizeDemo (since Java convention prefers each file/class pairing to match and to avoid confusion with finalize concept).

Added clean, clear comments.

Minor spacing adjustments for readability.

Clarified the comment on the generator method — the created object becomes unreachable immediately after the method ends.

Note:
To encourage garbage collection during testing (though it's unpredictable when it actually runs), you could optionally call:

java
Copy
Edit
System.gc();
inside the loop or after it — but it's just a suggestion to the JVM, not a guarantee.
