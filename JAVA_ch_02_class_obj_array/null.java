5. Show how a method called myMeth( ) is declared if it has a return type of double and has
two int parameters called a and b.
double myMeth(int a, int b) { // ...


6. How must a method return if it returns a value?
A method that returns a value must return via the return statement, passing back the return value in
the process.


7. What name does a constructor have?
A constructor has the same name as its class.


9. What is garbage collection and how does it work? What is finalize( )?
Garbage collection is the mechanism that recycles unused objects so that their memory can be reused.
An object’s finalize( ) method is called just prior to an object being recycled.


10. What is this?
The this keyword is a reference to the object on which a method is invoked. It is automatically passed
to a method.


11. Can a constructor have one or more parameters?
Yes.


12. If a method returns no value, what must its return type be?
void
