2.4 Methods with parameters
A value passed to a method is called an argument. Inside the method, the variable that receives the argument is called a parameter.  Example: devide(int x, int y)  here x and y are parameters but in  devide(2, 3)  2 and 3 are arguments.
	A parameter is within the scope of its method, and aside from its special task of receiving an argument, it acts like any other local variable.
	A method can have more than one parameter which separatef one from the next with a comma. Eg: 	devide(int x, int y)
	When using multiple parameters, each parameter specifies its own type, which can differ from the others. For example, this is perfectly valid:		int myMeth(int a, double b, float c){  }
