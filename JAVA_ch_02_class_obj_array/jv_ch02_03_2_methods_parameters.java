/* -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=      methods with parameters      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
    parameters and arguments:
        A value passed to a method is called an "argument". 
        Inside the method, the variable that receives the argument is called a "parameter".  
        Example: 
                    devide(int x, int y)
            
            here x and y are parameters but in    devide(2, 3)    2 and 3 are arguments.

    Scope of parameters:
        A parameter is within the scope of its method,
        aside from its special task of receiving an argument, it acts like any other local variable.

    A method can have more than one parameter       devide(int x, int y)


    multiple parameters:
        When a method has multiple parameters, each parameter specifies its own type, which can differ from the others. 
        For example, this is perfectly valid:
        
                    int myMeth(int a, double b, float c){  }
