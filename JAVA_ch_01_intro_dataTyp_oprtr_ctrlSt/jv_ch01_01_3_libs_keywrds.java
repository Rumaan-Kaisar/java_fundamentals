    The Java Keywords:
        Fifty keywords are currently defined in the Java language. 
            These keywords, combined with the 'syntax of the operators' and 'separators', form the definition of the Java language. 

        The keywords 'const' and 'goto' are reserved but not used. 
            You may not use these words for the names of variables, classes, and so on.            */

/*  The Java Class Libraries:
        The Java 'environment' relies on several 'built-in class libraries' 
            that contain many built-in methods that provide support for such things as 
                I/O, 
                string handling, 
                networking, and 
                graphics. 
                
            The standard classes also provide support for a graphical user interface (GUI). 
            Thus, Java as a totality is a combination of the 'Java language itself', plus its 'standard classe's. 
            
            The class libraries provide much of the functionality that comes with Java. 
                Indeed, part of becoming a Java programmer is learning to 'use the standard Java classes'. 


    Java is a free-form language, meaning that it does not matter 
        where you place statements relative to each other on a line (multiple statements on a line is acceptable).
