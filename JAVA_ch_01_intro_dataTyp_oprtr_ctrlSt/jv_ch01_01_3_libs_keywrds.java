1.5 The Java Keywords
Fifty keywords are currently defined in the Java language (see Table 1-1). These keywords, combined with the syntax of the operators and separators, form the definition of the Java language. In addition to the keywords, these are values defined by Java: true, false, and null. These keywords and values cannot be used as names for a variable, class, or method.

abstract 	case	continue 	enum 	for 	instanceof 	new 	return	switch 	transient 
assert 	catch 	default	extends 	goto	int 	package 	short 	synchronized	try 
boolean 	char 	do 	final	if 	interface 	private 	static 	this 	void
break 	class 	double 	finally 	implements	long 	protected 	strictfp 	throw 	volatile 
byte	const 	else 	float 	import 	native	public 	super	throws 	while
	The keywords const and goto are reserved but not used. 
	You may not use these words for the names of variables, classes, and so on.

1.6 The Java Class Libraries
The Java environment relies on several built-in class libraries that contain many built-in methods that provide support for such things as I/O, string handling, networking, and graphics. The standard classes also provide support for a graphical user interface (GUI). Thus, Java as a totality is a combination of the Java language itself, plus its standard classes. As you will see, the class libraries provide much of the functionality that comes with Java. Indeed, part of becoming a Java programmer is learning to use the standard Java classes. 
	Java is a free-form language, meaning that it does not matter where you place statements relative to each other on a line (multiple statements on a line is acceptable).
