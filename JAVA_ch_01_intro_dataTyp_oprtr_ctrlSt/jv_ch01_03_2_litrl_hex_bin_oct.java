    ----------------    literals    ----------------
    literals:
        fixed values that are represented in their human-readable form
        Java literals can be of any of the primitive data types. 
        The way each literal is represented depends upon its type
        
        For example, 
            'a' and ' %' are both character constants.
            10 and â€“100 are integer literals.
            11.123 is a floating-point literal.

        Literal specifier:
                By default, integer literals are of type "int". 
                    int can be assigned to variables of type 'char', 'byte', or 'short' 
                        as long as the value being assigned can be represented by the target type.

                long: 
                    To specify a long literal, append an 'l' or an 'L'. 
                    For example, 12 is an "int", but 12L is a "long".
                    An integer literal can always be assigned to a long variable.

                float:
                    By default, floating-point literals are of type 'double'. 
                    To specify a float literal, append an 'F' or 'f'.  
                    Eg:  "10.19F"  is of type 'float'.


    '_' into an integer or floatingpoint literal:
        When the literal is compiled, the underscores are simply discarded. 
        Here is an example: 123_45_1234

/*  --------------- Hexadecimal, Octal, and Binary literals ----------------
    Hexadecimal:
        A hexadecimal literal must begin with 0x or 0X (a zero followed by an x or X).
        int hex = 0xFF;     // 255 in decimal


    Octal:
        An octal literal begins with a zero.
        int oct = 011;      // 9 in decimal


    Binary:
        precede the binary number with a 0b or 0B.
        For example, following specifies the value 12 in binary:
        int binr = 0b1100;


    int undScrTest = 123_45_1234;
    System.out.println("undScrTest is " + undScrTest);

                Notice, System.out.println() prints those in "deciaml"

            System.out.println("oct is " + oct);

            // specify an integer literal by use of binary: precede the binary number with a 0b or 0B.

/* Java Octal to Decimal conversion: Integer.parseInt()
The Integer.parseInt() method converts a string to an int with the given radix. If you pass 8 as a 'radix', it converts an 'octal' string into 'decimal'.
