    readability:
        An expression in Java may have tabs and spaces in it to make it more readable
        The two expressions are the same, but the second is easier to read: 	
            x=10/y*(127/x);	 
            x = 10 / y * (127/x);

        Additional spaces makes a good readable code.

    precedence:
        Parentheses 'increase the precedence of the operations' contained within them, just like in ALGEBRA. 
        Use of 'redundant or additional parentheses' will not cause ERRORS or SLOW down the EXECUTION of the expression. 
    
        For example, which of the following two expressions is easier to read?

            x = y/3-34*temp+127;
            x = (y/3) - (34*temp) + 127;
