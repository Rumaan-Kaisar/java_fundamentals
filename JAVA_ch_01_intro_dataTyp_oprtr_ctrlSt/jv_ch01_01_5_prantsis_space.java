1.17 Spacing and parenthesis
The two expressions are the same, but the second is easier to read: 	x=10/y*(127/x);	 x = 10 / y * (127/x);
	Parentheses increase the precedence of the operations contained within them, just like in algebra. Use of redundant or additional parentheses will not cause errors or slow down the execution of the expression. 
	Additional spaces makes a good readable code.
