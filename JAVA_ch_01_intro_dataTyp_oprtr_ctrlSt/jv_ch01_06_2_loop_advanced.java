    ------------    FOR loop    ------------
    Following are the most traditional forms of the for

        Repeats a single statement:

            for(initialization; condition; iteration) statement;


        Repeats a block (similar to C/C++):

                for(initialization; condition; iteration){
                    // statement sequence
                }

            Initialization: 
                Sets the starting value of the loop control variable (often a counter that controls the loop)
                It is usually an assignment statement.

            Condition: 
                A "Boolean expression" that checks if the loop should continue

            Iteration: 
                Defines how the loop control variable changes after each loop cycle

            Semicolons: The three sections (initialization, condition, iteration) are separated by semicolons

------------    FOR-Loop Variations    ------------





[3]	It is possible for any or all of the initialization, condition, or iteration portions of the for loop to be blank.  For example, 
for(i=0; i<10; ) { 	System.out.println("Pass #" + i);
i++; }  	// increment loop control variable is inside the for loop 
	or iteration may not present at all. Eg:
for(i = 0;  (char)System.in.read() != 'S';  ) System.out.println("Again");
	The initialization portion can be moved out of the for:
int i = 0; 				// move initialization out of loop
for( ; i<10 ; ) { 	System.out.println("Pass #" + i); i++; }  
	The Infinite Loop: To create an infinite loop use the for by leaving the conditional expression empty. Eg:
for(;;){ } // intentionally infinite loop
This loop will run forever. (It can be terminated by using the break statement.)


[4]	Loops with No Body: In Java, the body associated with a for loop (or any other loop) can be empty. This is because a null statement is syntactically valid. They are often useful. For example, the following program uses one to sum the numbers 1 through 5: 	for(i = 1; i <= 5; sum += i++) ;
	Notice that the summation process is handled entirely within the for statement, and no body is needed. 
	Pay special attention to the iteration expression: 	sum += i++. It is equivalent to:    sum = sum + i; i++;

[5]	Declaring Loop Control Variables Inside the for Loop: Often the variable that controls a for is needed only for the purposes of the loop and is not used elsewhere. In this case, we declare the variable inside the initialization portion of the for. Eg:
int sum = 0, fact = 1;
for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) { 	sum += i; 	// i is known throughout the loop
fact *= i; }
	In this example, i is not accessible outside the for loop. If you need to use the loop control variable elsewhere in your program, you will not be able to declare it inside the for loop.
	Note: the scope of that variable ends when the for statement does. (That is, the scope of the variableis limited to the for loop.) Outside the for loop, the variable will cease to exist. 


[6]	The Enhanced for Loop: Relatively recently, a new form of the for loop, called the enhanced for, was added to Java. The enhanced for provides a streamlined way to cycle through the contents of a collection of objects, such as an array. We'll discuss with array.



1.22 while and do-while loop (similar to C/C++)
While loop:  	while(condition){}	Do-While loop: 	do{}while(condition);



1.23 Nested Loops: 	One loop can be nested inside of another. Eg: To find factors of numbers
for(int i=2; i <= 100; i++){ System.out.print("Factors of " + i + ": ");
  for(int j=2; j<i; j++) if((i%j) == 0) System.out.print(j + " ");
  System.out.println(); }

------------    FOR loop variations    ------------

Multi Loop-Control Var:
    Any number of "initialization" and "iteration" are possible
    "Commas" separate multiple initialization and iteration statements
    But, more than two or three make the the loop complicated

        for(i=0, j=10; i<j; i++, j--) {
            System.out.println("i and j: " + i + " " + j);
        }

    When the loop begins, both i and j are initialized.
    Each time the loop repeats, i is incremented and j is decremented in each iteration.


Boolean Condition Control:
    The loop-condition can be any valid Boolean expression, not just related to the loop control variable.
    Eg: the loop continues until the user types the letter 'S' at the keyboard:

        for(i = 0; (char)System.in.read() != 'S'; i++) {
            System.out.println("Pass #" + i);
        }


BLANK Sections in for Loop:
Any part (initialization, condition, iteration) of a for loop can be left blank.

Example:
java
Copy code
for(i = 0; i < 10;) { 
    System.out.println("Pass #" + i);
    i++; // Increment inside the loop body
}
You can also have an infinite loop with for(;;).
4. Loops with No Body:
The body of a for loop can be empty if all the logic is handled within the loop declaration.
Example:
java
Copy code
for(i = 1; i <= 5; sum += i++);
This loop sums numbers from 1 to 5, but there’s no body for the loop.
5. Declaring Variables Inside for Loop:
Loop control variables can be declared inside the loop.
Example:
java
Copy code
for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    sum += i;
}
The variable i exists only within the loop.
6. Enhanced for Loop:
Java offers an enhanced for loop for iterating over collections like arrays.
Example (used for arrays):
java
Copy code
for(int num : array) {
    System.out.println(num);
}
While and Do-While Loops:
while Loop:

java
Copy code
while(condition) {
    // statements
}
The loop checks the condition before executing the body.
do-while Loop:

java
Copy code
do {
    // statements
} while(condition);
The body is executed at least once, then the condition is checked.
Nested Loops:
You can have loops inside loops.
Example:
java
Copy code
for(int i = 2; i <= 100; i++) {
    System.out.print("Factors of " + i + ": ");
    for(int j = 2; j < i; j++) {
        if(i % j == 0) System.out.print(j + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
This example finds and prints the factors of numbers from 2 to 100.

Important Points to Remember: Control Flow in Java (Differences and Key Aspects Compared to C/C++)
1. for Loop Variations
Basic Structure:

java
Copy code
for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
    // body of loop
}
Initialization: executed once at the beginning.
Condition: checked before each iteration; loop runs as long as it's true.
Iteration: performed after each loop body execution.
Important Aspects:

Same as in C/C++ in terms of syntax and behavior.
Infinite Loop: Can be written like this (same as C/C++):
java
Copy code
for(;;) {
    // infinite loop
}
Multiple Initialization and Iteration Expressions: You can use multiple comma-separated expressions:
java
Copy code
for (int i = 0, j = 10; i < j; i++, j--) {
    // loop body
}
Differences from C/C++:

In Java, the scope of the variables declared in the initialization section is restricted to the body of the loop. In C++, variables can be declared outside and can have an extended scope.
2. while Loop
Basic Structure:

java
Copy code
while (condition) {
    // body of loop
}
Important Aspects:

The while loop evaluates the condition first, meaning if the condition is false at the start, the loop is never executed.
Same behavior in both Java and C/C++.
Infinite Loop:
java
Copy code
while (true) {
    // infinite loop
}
Control Flow Mechanism:

Condition evaluated first.
If the condition is true, the loop body is executed.
Repeat step 1.
3. do-while Loop
Basic Structure:

java
Copy code
do {
    // body of loop
} while (condition);
Important Aspects:

The do-while loop is similar to the while loop but with one key difference: the body of the loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false on the first evaluation.
Similar to C/C++.
Useful when the loop must run at least once before checking the condition.
Control Flow Mechanism:

The body is executed once before the condition is checked.
The condition is evaluated after each iteration.
If the condition is true, the loop continues; otherwise, it terminates.
Example:

java
Copy code
int i = 0;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
Difference from while:

The while loop checks the condition before execution of the loop body.
The do-while loop checks the condition after the loop body, so the loop is guaranteed to run at least once.
4. Nested Loops
Basic Structure:

java
Copy code
for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
    for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
        // inner loop body
    }
    // outer loop body
}
Important Aspects:

You can nest for, while, and do-while loops.
Loops are executed from the outermost to innermost, with the inner loop completing all its iterations for each iteration of the outer loop.
Similar in Java and C/C++.
Example of Nested for Loops:

java
Copy code
for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
        System.out.println("i: " + i + ", j: " + j);
    }
}
Output:

yaml
Copy code
i: 1, j: 1
i: 1, j: 2
i: 1, j: 3
i: 2, j: 1
i: 2, j: 2
i: 2, j: 3
i: 3, j: 1
i: 3, j: 2
i: 3, j: 3
Differences from C/C++:

Variable Scoping: In Java, variables declared in a loop have block-level scope (limited to the loop or block they are declared in). In C++, variables declared in a loop can have a different scope depending on how they are declared.
5. Additional Notes:
Java has an enhanced for-each loop (also called the enhanced for loop) which is useful for iterating through arrays and collections.
java
Copy code
for (int element : array) {
    // body of loop
}
This loop is not available in C/C++ and is specific to Java (and other modern languages like Python).
Differences in Java from C/C++:
Variable Declaration and Scope:

In Java, the scope of a variable declared inside the loop is limited to the loop. In C++, the scope can vary.
In Java, loop control variables can only be used within the loop unless declared outside the loop. In C++, their scope may differ based on declaration.
Enhanced for Loop in Java:

Java provides an additional for-each loop for working with arrays and collections, which does not exist in C++.
Break and Continue Behavior:

Both Java and C/C++ allow the use of break and continue statements, but Java's control-flow mechanisms like labels in combination with break are not commonly used in C++.
Type Checking:

Java is more strictly typed than C++, so implicit type conversions inside loops (e.g., promoting an int to a float) are handled differently.
Conclusion:
In summary, Java's control flow for loops (for, while, do-while) is quite similar to C/C++, but with some key differences in scoping rules, enhanced features like the enhanced for-each loop, and stricter type-checking. Keep in mind the specific characteristics of loops and variable scoping when transitioning from C++ to Java.






Yes, there are a few additional important facts to remember when using loops in Java, as well as some differences or special considerations compared to C/C++:

1. Type Promotion and Casting in Loops
In Java, arithmetic operations on smaller data types (like byte, char, short) result in promotion to int inside expressions. After the promotion, if the result needs to be assigned back to the smaller data type, you will need to explicitly cast the result back to the original type.
This is something to watch out for in loop iterations involving arithmetic operations on small types.
Example:

java
Copy code
byte b = 1;
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    b = (byte) (b + 1); // Requires explicit cast, as result is promoted to int
}
2. break and continue Statements
The break statement in Java (similar to C/C++) exits the nearest enclosing loop entirely.
The continue statement skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration.
Labeled break and continue: Java allows you to use labels with break and continue to break or continue outer loops. This feature doesn't exist in C/C++.
Example (Labeled break):

java
Copy code
outerLoop:
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        if (j == 1) {
            break outerLoop;  // Exits both loops
        }
        System.out.println("i = " + i + ", j = " + j);
    }
}
Output:
css
Copy code
i = 0, j = 0
3. Scope of Loop Variables
Variables declared within a loop in Java have block scope, which means they are only accessible within the loop where they are declared. After the loop finishes, the variable is no longer accessible.
This is similar to C++ unless the variables are declared outside the loop.
Example:

java
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    // i is accessible here
}
// i is no longer accessible here
4. The for-each Loop (Enhanced for Loop)
Java provides the enhanced for loop for iterating over arrays and collections. It simplifies the iteration process and reduces the chance of errors associated with loop boundaries.
You can only use it to read data, not modify the collection. This is different from regular for loops, where you have full control over the index.
Example:

java
Copy code
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int num : numbers) {
    System.out.println(num);
}
Important Points:

The enhanced for loop iterates through each element of the collection without requiring an index.
It's particularly useful for iterating over arrays, ArrayList, HashSet, and other collection types in Java.
Not present in C/C++.
5. Nested Loops and Performance
Nested loops are allowed in Java, just like in C/C++, but care should be taken when using nested loops due to potential performance issues, especially when the loops have high iteration counts (e.g., O(n^2) complexity).
Nested loops can also lead to complex code, so use them judiciously and refactor where possible.
6. Unreachable Code in Loops
Java has a strict rule against unreachable code. If a loop contains code that the compiler determines will never be reached (e.g., after an unconditional return or break), the compiler will produce an error.
This is slightly stricter than C/C++ compilers, which might not always catch unreachable code.
Example:

java
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    break; // Loop will break immediately
    System.out.println("This is unreachable"); // Causes a compilation error
}
7. Switch Expression in Java (Java 12+):
Java, from version 12 onwards, allows the switch expression, which simplifies the use of switch by making it an expression that can return a value.
This feature is not present in C/C++.
Example:

java
Copy code
int dayOfWeek = 2;
String day = switch (dayOfWeek) {
    case 1 -> "Monday";
    case 2 -> "Tuesday";
    default -> "Invalid day";
};
System.out.println(day);
8. Floating Point Loops
Be cautious when using floating-point numbers as loop counters. Due to the inaccuracy of floating-point arithmetic, conditions may not behave as expected.
This problem exists in both Java and C/C++, but Java has stricter type-checking, which might prevent some issues upfront.
Example of a potential issue:

java
Copy code
for (float f = 0.1f; f != 1.0f; f += 0.1f) {
    System.out.println(f);
}
// May not terminate as expected due to floating-point precision issues
9. Iterator vs. for Loop
When iterating over collections (like ArrayList or HashSet), it's generally preferable to use an Iterator or an enhanced for-each loop in Java.
Unlike C++, Java doesn’t provide pointer-based iteration but rather object-based iterators.
The use of Iterator ensures fail-safe behavior, meaning it avoids ConcurrentModificationException when modifying collections during iteration.
Example:

java
Copy code
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("A");
list.add("B");
Iterator<String> iterator = list.iterator();
while (iterator.hasNext()) {
    System.out.println(iterator.next());
}
10. Final Variables in Loops
In Java, final variables (constants) cannot be modified inside a loop. They must be initialized only once.
This is a stricter enforcement compared to C++, where const variables have a similar but slightly different set of rules.
Example:

java
Copy code
final int limit = 5;
for (int i = 0; i < limit; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);  // Works fine, but you cannot modify `limit`
}
Summary of Key Differences and Facts:
Java provides the enhanced for-each loop, not available in C/C++.
Variable scoping is stricter in Java, especially within loop bodies.
Strict type-checking and promotion rules apply inside expressions (e.g., promoting smaller types like byte to int).
Labeled break and continue in Java provide more control over nested loops, which are not available in C++.
Iterator-based loops are preferred for collections in Java, whereas C++ uses pointer-based iterations.
Java’s switch expression (Java 12+) enhances control flow by making switch more expressive compared to C++.
These differences are essential to understand when transitioning between Java and C/C++ or when using loops effectively in Java.
